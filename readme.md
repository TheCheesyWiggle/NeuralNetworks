# Neural Netowrks

This project is a introdution to neural networks and how they operate. This project is a multi-layer perceptron aimed at recognising hand drawn digits. I used 3Blue1Browns neural network playlist as a reference point for this project. The data set used is the MNIST database of hand drawn digits (http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/). Hopefully be able to tie this in with hardware in the future to create some cool projects.
